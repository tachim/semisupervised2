Implementations for both CRF AE from Waleed Ammar paper and new implentation with CRF AE using variational lower bound formulation


Usage
- Run create_bclusters.sh to generate brown cluster file for words
- Run experiments from main.py


ToDo
- Convert raw data POS tags to univeral tags (size 44 -> 12)
- Complete implementation of optimization method - need to find gradient
- Run benchmark tests on both models
